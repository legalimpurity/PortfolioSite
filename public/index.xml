      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Rajat Khanna, a mobile app developer based in New Delhi, India. I love Technology, and am a big fan of every aspect of it. My interest in Technology was born with the intriguing questions that kept arousing in my mind since childhood, about how things around work. These forced me to explore every technology around, from simple transistors to modern day LED TV&amp;rsquo;s.
I am a passionate mobile app developer, who is enchanted by the power of mobile applications and its impact on mankind.</description>
