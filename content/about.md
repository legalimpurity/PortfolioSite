### I'm **Rajat Khanna**, a **mobile app developer** based in New Delhi, India.

I love Technology, and am a big fan of every aspect of it. My interest in Technology was born with the intriguing questions that kept arousing in my mind since childhood, about how things around work. These forced me to explore every technology around, from simple transistors to modern day LED TV's.

I am a **passionate mobile app developer**, who is enchanted by the power of mobile applications and its impact on mankind. My second hobby is **security testing** wherein I just like to break the walls for the challenge in it. Being inclined towards the Open-source languages, I have developed in **ruby, python and PHP**.

Being a **network designer and administrator**, I have good experience of working with **linux boxes and Cisco routers**. I also love electronics a lot and have done a few **embedded projects**. Blessed with creative skills, I have designed many **multimedia projects** in my school and college life.

Today I engineer and design apps from the ground up using the technologies I've learned and the tools that make it easier. Currently, I am working at [Amity University](http://amity.edu/).
