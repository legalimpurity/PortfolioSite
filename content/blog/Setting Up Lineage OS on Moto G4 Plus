Hello All.

A very strange coincidence that I am writing again exactly after 13 months. Anyways, so recently I have been thinking a lot about the impact google has on my life and how to reduce it. I never really adopted Google Chrome for the same reason that I was already using a lot of google products. Been using firefox sync from 10 years now.
Last night I randomly decided to stop using GApps on my primary phone again. Here is a small guide on how to flash Lineage OS (a successor to CaynogenMod) on Moto G4 Plus.


### 1. Check if phone is supported.
First of all it is very important to check if Lineage supports your phone or not. Head over to [Lineage OS Downloads Page](https://download.lineageos.org/) and find yoru device's model. After that another problem people find later in the process is bootloader unlocking. If your phone supports bootloader unlocking, that will be be the easiest way to do this, and this guide operates under the assumption that your phone supports this feature. If it doesn’t, like most Samsung devices, a bit more research on your particular model will be necessary. If your phone does not support bootloader unlocking there are ways too root various phones on the internet. I suggest you give it a try. As far as Motorola phones go, they do support bootloader unlocking so we are going to go that way and play with this extremely safely.

### 2. Download all the necessary files.
1. Download Custom recovery from [TWRP](https://twrp.me/). head over to their HomePage and go to Devices. Therein search for your device. For motorola, I searched "Motorola Moto g4" and found my device. Then click on your device and go to Download Links section. Use any of the mirrors to download the latest version of twrp.

2. If you searched for your device on [Lineage OS Downloads Page](https://download.lineageos.org/) earlier then your job is already half done. Just download the latest nightly build from their page(All their builds are nightly!).
 ** I wont be installing GApps because duh! and i also dont require root access to the phone so wont be flashing super user.**

3. Enable developer mode and enable USB debugging. Again there are a lot of tutorials on how to do that so wont be covering that. For Moto G4 Plus users Please enable 'Allow OEM Unlock' in Developer options. This will save you a lot of time.

```console
adb reboot bootloader
```

```console
fastboot oem unlock
```
Note: This will factory reset your phone, so do make sure you’ve backed it up first!
